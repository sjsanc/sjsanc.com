## Gear

### Laptop 
I bought a Framework 13 in 2024. Inside is a Ryzen 7 7840U and enough onboard graphics to play Rimworld. It also has an obnoxious 64 GiB of memory. I rarely use more than 12.

### Mouse
Logitech Pebble M350

### Audio
Cheap Marshall Minor III in-ear headphones. I'm not much of an audiophile.

## Software

I've used Arch for like, 5 years. I like being able to say "that's there because I put it there".
- wm: `sway`
- term: `ghostty`
- shell: `fish`
- notifications: `mako`
- bar: `waybar`
- fonts: `jetbrains` | `ibm plex` | `cozette-otb`
- editor: `helix`, `vscode` and `rider` for .NET
- pdfs: `okular`
- notes: `obsidian` w/ sync
- books: `calibre`

I write lots of Go, Typescript and C#.
