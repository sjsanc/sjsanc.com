## Gear

### Laptop 
I bought a Framework 13 in 2024. Inside is a Ryzen 7 7840U and enough onboard graphics to play Rimworld. It also has an obnoxious 64 GiB of memory. I rarely use more than 12.

### Mouse
Logitech Pebble M350

### Audio
Cheap Marshall Minor III in-ear headphones. I'm not much of an audiophile.
