## Hi

I'm a software engineer from somewhere in the UK.
Here's some stuff I'd like to share:

- [pacviz](github.com/sjsanc/pacviz) - alternative TUI for pacman (Go)
- [encard](github.com/sjsanc/encard) - a filesystem-based flashcard tool (Go)
- [aoc](github.com/sjsanc/advent-of-code) - Advent of Code in a bunch of languages
- [dotfiles](github.com/sjsanc/dotfiles) - config files for my laptop
