## Hi

I'm a software engineer from somewhere in the UK.

Here's some stuff I'd like to share:

- [encard](https://github.com/sjsanc/encard) - a filesystem-based flashcard tool.
- [dotfiles](https://github.com/sjsanc/dotfiles) - config files for my laptop.
- [advent-of-code](https://github.com/sjsanc/advent-of-code) - AOC in a bunch of languages.
